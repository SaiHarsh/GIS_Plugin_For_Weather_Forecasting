# GIS_Plugin_For_Weather_Forecasting
The idea is to create a QGIS plugin that takes historial data of weather as input to generate a graphical visualization and prediction using Machine Learning model for future. 

#QGIS open source platform
QGIS (Quantum GIS) is a widely used open-source platform for analysis and processing of geographical data, that has applications in domains that involve maps and spatial analysis.

#Input data specification
Input data has 
1. Statistics of weather changes in a given region.
2. Latitude and longitude of data collecting units
3. Duration over which data was collected. 

# Prediction Model
We plan to use a machine learning model either Linear regression or Neural network(yet to decide).
